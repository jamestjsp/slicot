"""
pytest configuration for SLICOT tests.

KNOWN ISSUE (macOS):
When running the full test suite (2600+ tests) on macOS, pytest may crash
with "Fatal Python error: Segmentation fault" or "Aborted" after ~750 tests. 
This is caused by a bug in macOS Accelerate framework (BLAS/LAPACK) that 
corrupts internal state or stack after many LAPACK calls.

Workaround: Run tests in batches.
A script is provided: `tools/run_tests_batched.py`
Usage: python3 tools/run_tests_batched.py

Note: Mixing OpenBLAS with Accelerate-linked NumPy causes immediate crashes,
so switching BLAS is not a viable solution unless NumPy is also rebuilt.

ASAN on Linux passes all tests - no memory issues detected.
